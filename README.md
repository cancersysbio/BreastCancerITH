# Heterogeneity Metrics

The purpose of this repository is to calculate relevant **tumor heterogeneity metrics** using mutation calls from *multiregion sequencing (MRS)* of human tumor specimens. All of the metrics except for `tHFR` take as input mutation calls from multiple regional samples from within the same timepoint. `tHFR` takes as input one set of *"pre-treatment"* mutations as well sets of mutations from multiple *"post-treatment"* regions. These heterogeneity metrics can be used to measure **genetic divergence** between regions and test for clonal evolution across time (`tHFR`).
